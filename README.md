# Temperature Converter - jQuery to React Migration

This is a migration of the Form App from jQuery to React. The original implementation used jQuery for handling form submission and displaying an alert message. Now, it has been migrated to React, utilizing React's state and components.

## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript
- CSS

## Migration Process

The migration involved the following steps:

1. Set up a new React project using `create-react-app`.
2. Created a new `App` component as the entry point of the application.
3. Refactored the HTML structure of the form using React components and JSX syntax.
4. Replaced the jQuery code with React state and event handlers.
5. Created state variables to store the form input values and alert message.
6. Implemented event handlers to update the state variables based on user input and form submission.
7. Utilized the `fetch` API to simulate form submission to a fictitious server.
8. Added CSS styles to achieve the desired form layout and appearance.
9. Created a new `AlertCustom` component to display the alert message.
10. Conditionally rendered the `AlertCustom` component based on form validation and submission.

## Usage

To use the Form App, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the application using `npm start`.
4. Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Acknowledgements

This migration was done as a learning exercise to understand the process of migrating from jQuery to React. The original Form App was created using jQuery and served as a basis for the migration process.

## Conclusion

The migration from jQuery to React has allowed us to take advantage of the benefits of a modern JavaScript framework, such as improved performance, better organization of code, and easier maintenance. The React components and state management provide a more structured and declarative approach to building interactive forms.

By completing this migration, we have successfully transformed the original jQuery-based application into a more scalable, maintainable, and efficient React application.
